Standalone Jasmine
------------------

I'm including the standalone, static-web-file-based, released version of Jasmine as it's the simplest way to get tests running in this environment. Ordinarily I'd use a build system and a test runner of some sort (ex: Webpack + Karma). This does mean I have to manually specify both source and spec files; that's not too onerous for this small project.
